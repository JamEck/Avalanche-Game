MUST install the SDL 2.0 framework before compiling

In the future, I will include a build in the repo,
however I only have a Mac binary.

Climb the tower of blocks as they fall!
Don't get crushed, and watch out for the rising lava!

The higher you climb, the higher your score.

Split-screen 2-Player is supported!
	Press 2 to toggle Player 2 on/off

P1 Controls: WASD  keys to move, Space to jump
P2 Controls: Arrow keys to move, Comma to jump

Regain jump either by landing, or touching the wall of a block.

Use screen wrapping to your advantage.

Game is lost when all players are either crushed, 
 or touched by the rising lava. 

Game will automatically reset once all players have died and
 have fallen to the ground.
